Class: CS325 Analysis of Algorithms
Project #: 2
Description: Program uses three different
algorithms to find the minimum number of
coins necessary to make change for a given
amount.

How to Execute:
---------------
- This program is written in Python.

- How to output to [input filename]change.txt:
    - While in the project directory, run the following statement in your terminal: python project2.py [input filename]
    - Make sure you do not include the ".txt" extension; it will be appended for you.
    - For example, for some input file "test.txt" you would type: python project2.py test

- [input filename]change.txt should now be created in the project directory with the correct results for all three algorithms.

- The file contains a header with the name of each algorithm prior to its set of results.

Assumptions:
------------
- The given array V contains coin values in sorted, ascending order.

Testing Machine:
----------------
